# Project Overview

Indie Radio is a web-based platform designed to empowers independent DJs, radio hosts, and artists to broadcast live shows, archive past sessions, and engage with listeners in real-time through live chat and interactive features.

The platform focuses on providing a seamless experience across both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring that listeners can reach their favourite creators anywhere, anytime. Whether hosting scheduled broadcasts or going live spontaneously, Indie Radio aims to make radio broadcasting as accessible and community-driven as modern video streaming platforms.
